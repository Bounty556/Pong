	Memory Manager for the Soul engine. This works by creating a memory arena that
	can have memory partitioned in it from anywhere in the program.

	This first needs to be initialized by calling Initialize(), and must
	be cleaned up when the program closes via Shutdown().

	There are currently two ways to partition memory:
	
	1. Partitioning using the PARTITION macro, which will initialize the object in place of the
	   partitioned memory.

	2. Partitioning using the PARTITION_ARRAY macro. This will not initialize any of the objects
	   in the array, so care will need to be taken to initialize them manually.
	   Ex:
	   m_Controls = PARTITION_ARRAY(Input, 4); // Partition
	   for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
	   {
	       new (m_Controls + i) Input(); // Initialize
	   }

	To free memory from the memory arena, call FreeMemory(). This will allow the
	space that variable took up to be marked as usable again. ALL MEMORY SHOULD
	BE FREED BEFORE DEALLOCATING THE MEMORY ARENA!!!!! (this does not include
	primitives)

	A side effect of using the MemoryManager is that there is an implicit way to
	keep track of the size of an array that was partitioned into the memory arena.
	Simply use the GetByteSize() function to find the byte length of the array
	partitioned, and then you can divide that by the size of the object/primitive
	partitioned to get the array size.
